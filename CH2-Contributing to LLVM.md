- Contributing to an open source project can take many forms. Here are a few examples that we will cover in this chapter:
  - Reporting issues
  - Engaging in conversations in the public forum
  - Reviewing code
  - Contributing patches
- Include the configuration:
  - The version of LLVM
  - The OS
  - How LLVM was built
  - Anything that you think may be relevant (e.g., host CPU, etc.)
  - Upload the reduced input
  - Provide the steps to reproduce
    - Download myCoupleTensOfLines.ll
    - Run opt -passes=YY myCoupleTensOfLines.ll
    - Measure the compile time
    - Download myCoupleTensOfLinesWithASmallTweak.ll
    - Run opt -passes=YY myCoupleTensOfLinesWithASmallTweak.ll
    - Measure the compile time
    - Notice how the small tweak increases the compile time by 10x
  - Explain how the observed behavior departs from the expected behavior
  - Add labels to help identify which component is at fault if you can
